# 0x05. Python - Exceptions

In the previous lesson, we learned about basic data types in Python such as numbers, strings, and lists. In this lesson, we will learn how to handle exceptions and errors that may occur
### What is an exception? ###

An **exception** in programming refers to a way for the program to handle runtime errors gracefully, instead of causing the program to crash or produce incorrect output when something unexpected happens.

Exceptions are typically triggered by invalid operations such as division by zero, accessing an index that doesn't exist, etc.

Exceptions are typically used with control flow statements like `try`, `except`, and `finally
